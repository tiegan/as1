Note: as1/src contains everything from the original tiegan-HabitTracker folder.

A brief overview: This is a habit tracker. In it, you can track habits. You start on the main menu with 3 options: Add Habit, View Habits (not accessible at first) and Delete Habits. You start by first adding a habit, which contains a name, a date and a list of days that you want to do the habit on. The name must not already be associated with another habit. Next, you go into view habits, and you can click on a habit to see it's stats: the name, the date added with it, the days it is to be completed on, the number of times it's been completed (days then total) and finally whether or not it was completed that day. You can click on a button that confirms you did the habit. You can then view the completions you had on various days, and even delete them if you so choose. Finally, if you just decide all your habits suck and you want to start over, you just go to Delete Habits and click yes.

Super simple, right?

Code: A lot of code was either borrowed from lonelyTwitter, or done by myself. However, for the pieces of code I needed to get off the internet, here are the references:
